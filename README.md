### TritoLL

I'm a hobbyist game developer and full-time IT student!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my portfolio, built with React.
- âš¡ I use Unity as my game engine of choice, with C# as my language.
- ðŸŒ± In college, I'm learning C#, SQL, HTML/CSS/JS and more.
- ðŸ¤” I have an old game development project that I hope to bring back to life soon.
